# 🏥 Heart Disease Classification  

## 📌 Overview  
This project applies **machine learning classification techniques** to predict the likelihood of **heart disease** based on patient data. The dataset contains various health-related features, and the goal is to build an accurate predictive model.  

## 📊 Dataset  
- **Source:** `heart.csv`  
- **Target Variable:** `HeartDisease` (Binary classification: 0 = No, 1 = Yes)  
- **Features:** Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Resting BP, Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar, Resting ECG, Max Heart Rate, Exercise-Induced Angina, ST Depression, etc.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:**  
  - `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` (Data Handling & Visualization)  
  - `sklearn` (Machine Learning Models & Preprocessing)  

## 🏗️ Machine Learning Models Used  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
- **Decision Tree Classifier**  
- **Cross-validation for performance evaluation**  

## 📝 Steps in the Project  
1. **Data Loading & Exploration**  
2. **Preprocessing & Feature Encoding**  
3. **Train-Test Split & Scaling**  
4. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
5. **Performance Metrics (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Cross-validation Scores)**  

## 📊 Model Evaluation  
- The models were evaluated based on **accuracy scores** and **confusion matrices** to determine the best-performing approach.
